# Hello, World! - Hacktoberfest 2019

Submit a PR solving Hello, World! in a different language

## Rules

* Program should print "Hello, World!"
* Create a file in `languages` with the language name as the file name (followed by the language file extension)
  * If your language has special characters (C++ for example), replace with however the language traditionally expresses the language (cpp)
* Lowercase language names are preferred (`Dart.dart` should be `dart.dart`)
* If you find a problem with any of the files, open a PR to change it!
